                        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                        <p>This Privacy Policy statement is made by the Webito Infotech Group consisting of all the entities
                            listed here (collectively, “Webito Infotech”, “we”, “us” or “our”) and is effective as of 25th
                            May 2018. It applies to all our divisions: Webito Infotech Infotech Limited and Netlancers Inc
                            DBA Webito Infotech.</p>
                        <h4>Webito Infotech’s Privacy Commitment</h4>
                        <p>Webito Infotech has worried about customer and user privacy for almost 20 years, long before it
                            become politically correct, fashionable, or legally binding to take such position. We ask /
                            collect only the least amount of information necessary gathering only when we believe is
                            essential for doing business, or for the specific transaction at hand. We let customers know the
                            information we have on them and allow them to opt out for specific engagements. But, our biggest
                            commitment is that we do not make a single dollar from advertising revenu-never have, never
                            will, even if you just have submit a enquiry for project and does not opt to our services. We
                            avoid the fundamental conflict of interest between gathering customer information and fueling
                            advertising revenue, and the inevitable compromises in customer privacy that it brings.</p>
                        <p>The goal of this policy is to make explicit the information we gather on our customers and
                            website users, how we will use it, and how we will not. This policy is unfortunately longer that
                            we would like, but we must unambiguously address all the relevant cases. We will try and keep
                            the language simple and direct as much as possible.</p>
                        <h2>Scope of this Privacy Policy</h2>
                        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all Webito Infotech websites that link to it. It also applies to
